	<h1>Recommendations</h1>
	<p>This page will talk about some different computer builds, recommend different
	websites for use, and talk about consoles over computers.</p>

			<p>Consoles are great for easy fun and providing co-op play to enjoy with
			friends, and provide a level playing field in competitive games. However,
			they do not have nearly as many titles are a PC, as coding for PC is easier,
			and can be done by anyone, thus allowing indie companies to make a game with
			ease. They also usually have a limited frame rate on all their games, which
			means that the game will cap out at a certain frames per second and not give
			more. This makes most games smooth and none noticeably better than another
			cinema wise. In most cases, this wont matter, since everyone is experiencing
			the same pictures at that point. However, computers can allow for frame rates
			going into the thousands, allowing for the monitor or TV to be able to pick
			from a variety of frames and gives you a very, very slight advantage in games.
			In the end, the difference does not matter, but it is something to think 
			about.</p></div>

			<p>High end and low end computers are an interesting topic. One is clearly
			superior to the other in power, but costs much more as a result, and in most
			cases, neither is better. What is meant by this is that when running a stream,
			keeping a few tabs open on an internet browser, and playing a game, the high
			end PC will have the same frame rate as the low end pc when playing the same 
			game. This is a generalization, and there are plenty of exceptions to this,
			but it is why the questions to start were asked. If you are looking for some
			casual fun, it may be best to buy a middle ground or cheap rig. If you are
			looking to stream and play, or to simply have the edge over your opponents,
			then it is best to buy the more expensive parts. Some great places to get 
			prebuilt computers are <a href="https://www.newegg.com/">newegg.com</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/site/landingpage/who-we-are?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkovNlrrx1wIVhksNCh2snwKbEAAYASAAEgISo_D_BwE">ibuypower.com</a> and 
			<a href="https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/page/Intel/i7/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkovNlrrx1wIVhksNCh2snwKbEAAYAiAAEgLUTfD_BwE">cyberpowerpc.com</a>. You can buy both Desktops and Laptops on all 4 of those
			sites and have them shipped right to you. On top of that, some of those sites
			also allow for monthly payments on the PC, instead of coming right out with a
			hefty sum. As far as building a PC goes, you can find great parts on 
			newegg.com and amazon.com, and they even sell bundles, where they have all the
			parts to build the computer, add the cost, and in most cases reduce the 
			overall price by a certain percentage.</p></div>
