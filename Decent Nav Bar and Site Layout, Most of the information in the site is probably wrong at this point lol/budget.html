		<h2>Budget</h2>
		<p>Budget is always a factor with any sort of investment. The biggest question when it
		comes to it is how much you are willing to spend, and whether or not you think it is
		justified. Some questions to answer justification are as follows.</p> 
		<p>How much time are you going to spend on the machine?</p> 
		<p>How much power does it really need?</p> 
		<p>What does it need to do while you are using it?</p>
		<p>The answers to these questions will help you get an idea of what you need and how
		much it will probably cost. It also helps to answer what kind of gaming you are going
		to be doing. If you're just going to be playing games casually, and nothing else, for
		example, you may not want to spend a lot of money on the machine, and more on games.
		If you want to get into it and really use the machine a lot, or use it for hardcore
		reasons, then you will want to spend more on it. Let us jump right into it.</p>
		<h2>Low Budget & Casual</h2>
		<p>If you have a low budget, there are a few options you can look at to be able to
		play the games you want to play without problems such as framerate drops or slow load 
		times. The same goes for casual gaming. If you're not looking to spend a whole lot of
		time playing, then it may be better not to spend a whole lot on a big and powerful
		computer. Here are some options for this catagory.</p>

				<h3>Xbox One</h3>
				<p>Microsoft's gaming console, the Xbox, has gone through a couple generations 
				now. It is only around 500$ for the newest model of the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/consoles?&ocid=PLATFORM_SEM_google_buy%20xbox%20one&cid=PLATFORM_SEM_google_buy%20xbox%20one&wt.srch=1&wt.mc_id=AID_SEM_B3jnTWpe#shop">Xbox One</a>, and can be found 
				cheaper depending on where you look. It will play all of the current games, but
				only if they are released for it, which most major titles are. The Xbox One can
				also play quiet a few of the older titles from the xbox 360. It even has some
				titles that are only released for it. There are few drawbacks to the Xbox One, 
				most of them are just a matter of opinion.</p></div>

				<h3>Playstation 4</h3>
				<p>Sony's gaming console, the Playstation, has gone through 3 generations now,
				not including their hand held variants. The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4/systems/#ps4-pro">Playstation 4</a> can be bought for 400$, and can be
				found for cheaper depending on where you look. It will play all of the current
				games, but only if they are released for it, which most major titles are. The
				Playstation 4 also is capable of playing most of the older games from the
				Playstation 3. It even has some titles that are only released for it. There are 
				few drawbacks to the Playstation 4, most of them are just a matter of opinion.</p></div>

				<h3>Wii U</h3>
				<p>A tad older than the other 2 consoles by only a year, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/wiiu/buynow">Wii U</a> is nintendo's
				newest console. It can play all of the old wii titles, but it only plays nintendo
				titles for the most part. It can be bought for 400$ or cheaper, depending on where 
				you look. The drawback is that in most cases you would want to buy this only to 
				play nintendo games, and not if you are interested in playing other games, as it 
				cannot play most other titles.</p></div>

			<div>
				<h3>Low Budget PC Build</h3>
				<p>These are common to find, and easy to make. They can play all the new titles
				at a moderate frame rate and with decent power. Prices range from 400$ to 700$, 
				depending on the time of the year, where you buy the computer, and whether or not 
				it came prebuilt or if you bought the parts and assembled it yourself. They are 
				capable machines, and in most cases you save money in the long run because loads 
				of sales on games for the PC happen all the time. The drawback of low budget PC 
				builds is that you have to priorities what you are using it for, and not try to do 
				everything all at once, as having loads of programs open at the same time will
				slow your computer down and can even make it stop working altogether.</p></div>

		<h2>Competitive & Hardcore</h2>
		<p>For the most part, if you're looking to play a lot of different games, or looking
		at playing a game competitively, you will want to buy a computer. In some cases,
		consoles are what you want to buy, as they are the only ones with the game you want to
		play, or because they have a game that is competitive on the console as well. But in
		most cases, PC gaming allows for money to be saved in the long run from games being
		put on sale. More information is given on the Recommendations page.</p>
		<h2>Streaming</h2>
		<p>Streaming in this case talks about uploading real time footage to a service while
		you play so that people can watch you play. The reason this has its own section is
		because streaming and gaming at the same time takes a substantial tole on your
		computer, and almost always needs a second monitor or tv so that you can see your
		stream while you play and make sure everything is working properly. More detail is
		given on the Recommendations page.</p>
