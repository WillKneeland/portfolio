<h1>History of the Internet</h1>

<h2>The Internet</h2>
<p>The Internet was originally created in 1967 as "ARPANET" which was based on packet switching networks.
Leonard Kleinrock, a student out of mit, had decided that a better way to share information was needed.
He had determined that the packet switching technology he had studied would be the best way to do it. He
gathered together a lot of other scientists, and together they worked to set up a system of computers, all
using packet switching to communicate and talk with each other. The plan for this was published in 1967,
the project was completed in 1968, and was demonstrated at the International Computer Communication 
Conference in 1972, where the concept of email was talked about. From there, ARPANET took off into the 
stars.</p>
