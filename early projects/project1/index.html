	<h2>My name is William Kendrick Kneeland</h2>

	<p>I am a very willing person, I enjoy working, especially on the things I love. I am a very big
	idea man too. I come up with ideas and stories all the time and work to try and use them in some
	way. Sometimes I come out with a product that I am happy with, sometimes I do not. Either way, I
	always try something at least once, and if I do not come up with the end result that I wanted,
	at least I tried. I'm very good at making deadlines, and very aware of what time I have available
	for meetings and other things. I am very good at calling in advance at letting people know if I
	through some rare incident I cannot make it to something. I am very good at managing stress and
	not letting things get to me so that I am the most productive I can be at all times. I am a very
	good worker and will not let down any potential employers.</p>

	<p>The mission of this website is to impress professors and potential employers with my ability
	to make a fluid and visually appealing website that describes me as a person and a worker. The
	site will have a section made to show a resume, a section to show my education, and a personal
	section to give a better idea of who I am personally.</p>

	<div id="resume"></div>

	<p>This site should be a way to pad the application to any employment opportunity and to show 
	professors what I have achieved so far in my education.</p>

	<p>One of my favorite pass times is to gather knowledge of different programs so that I can better
	use them in future projects. I also enjoy hanging out with friends, either in person or in a video
	game. I love coding, to make something from nothing makes me feel very happy. Even when the code
	is not acting the way I want it to, working around such issues in itself is very rewarding. I love
	going on walks to clear my head too, it is therapeutic, and helps me come up with answers to
	problems much faster. I also love pets, I hope to one day get another dog.</p>
